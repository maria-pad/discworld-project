<h2>The Lancre Coven</h2>

   <img src ="german-wyrd-sisters-illustration-by-kataryna-oleska.png" alt="Wyrd Sisters"  width="70%">
<p>The main witches in the Discworld series of books are the Lancre Coven: Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg, Magrat Garlick and later Agnes Nitt. They began as a parody of the Three Witches in Macbeth, and also as a reworking of the Maiden, Mother and Crone archetypes (the Triple Goddess). It could also be said that they each represent a different stereotype of witches: Granny is the classic fairy tale witch, Nanny the village wise woman and Magrat the modern romantic Wiccan. A sub-series of children's books introduces a new witch character, Tiffany Aching, who has been gradually tied into the main Witch story line as her series develops.</p>
<p>It has been explained in the books that three witches are required for a coven. Two witches get on each other's nerves; the third one gets them to make up, so they can all get on the nerves of everyone else. If a coven has more than three members, they all get on each others' nerves. (It is also mentioned that the true collective noun for a group of witches is not "coven", but "argument".)</p>

<h2>Granny Weatherwax</h2>

   <img src ="granny-weatherwax-by-dionysiajones.jpg" alt="Granny Weatherwax"  width="80%">
<p>Esmerelda "Esme" Weatherwax (usually called Granny Weatherwax or 'Mistress Weatherwax' on formal occasions. She was a witch and member of the Lancre coven. Granny Weatherwax wore a plain black dress, a somewhat battered black cloak and a tall, pointed witch's hat, skewered to her 'iron-hard gray bun' hairstyle with multiple hatpins. She was thin, and, while not really that tall, has such a commanding presence that she seemed tall. She had blue eyes and a penetrating gaze.</p>
<p>In the triple nature of a coven (maiden, mother, and crone), Granny Weatherwax was officially the crone although she has difficulty matching the classic old hag appearance; she still has perfect skin, not a single wart and all her teeth, although she has picked up a penetrating stare and plenty of worry lines.</p>
<p>Granny Weatherwax has a near-unshakeable belief in her own abilities, which has thus far proved accurate, and an extreme distrust of stories. She feels little need for personal possessions and keeps most of them in a single wooden box.</p>
<p>She is also highly adept at 'Borrowing' â€“ the art of overlaying her mind on the mind of another creature so that she can see through its eyes and steer its actions without it being aware of her presence. She has even borrowed a beehive, considered one of the most difficult minds to borrow due to it being spread over many bodies. In Wyrd Sisters, her second appearance, she makes contact with the very mind of Lancre itself. However, while her mind is out Borrowing, her body falls into a catatonic, almost death-like trance; it is revealed that, in order to prevent embarrassing accidents, she has taken to wearing a placard reading "I Ate'nt Dead" when she does so.</p>

<h2>Nanny Ogg</h2>

<p>The character of Nanny Ogg is based on the Mother stereotype of the Triple Goddess myth. She's had 5 husbands and been married to three of them and has fifteen children who survived their early childhood (one was born some ten years after the death of her last husband). She has as well innumerable grandchildren and great-grandchildren, but that's incidental; what makes her the Mother is her mentality. People go to Granny Weatherwax for help when they have no choice, but they go to Nanny for advice all the time. Granny is respected, but Nanny is actually liked. She is wiser than Esme Weatherwax in some ways, and certainly wise enough not to show it. Nanny Ogg is seen as "one of the people" in a way that Esme isn't.</p>
<p>She is wiser than Esme Weatherwax in some ways, and certainly wise enough not to show it. Nanny Ogg is seen as "one of the people" in a way that Esme isn't. While Granny thinks there's no point in competing if you aren't going to win, Nanny reckons the sympathy you get for being a good runner-up is much better. Granny comes across as judgemental, whereas Nanny has a mind so broad she could tie it under her chin. She appears to be kinder than Granny, but is equally prepared to make tough decisions if necessary.</p>
<p>Contrary to Granny Weatherwax, and indeed the stereotype of witches in general, Nanny Ogg doesn't live in an isolated, crumbly rural cottage but in an expansive and well-looked after town house in the capital of Lancre, called Tir Nani Ogg ("Nanny Ogg's place," and a pun on the Gaelic name for the Land of the Ever-Young). She fills it with knick-knacks such as pink skulls and rude garden gnomes that serve no useful purpose except to highlight her eccentricities. She shares this home with Greebo, a tomcat of evil aroma and astonishing viciousness, whom she can see only as a fuzzy harmless kitten.</p>

<h2>Magrat Garlick</h2>

   <img src ="MagratGarlick.jpg" alt="Magrat Garlick"  width="80%">
<p>Magrat Garlick (pronounced Magg-rat) would have been called Margaret but her mother couldn't spell it properly. Her mother was Simplicity Garlick, her maternal grandmother was Araminta Garlick and her maternal aunt was Yvonnel Garlick. Witches don't pay much attention to the paternal line. Magrat is thin, has a frequently red nose and an unruly mass of frizz and split ends that still awaits a Good Hair Day.</p>
<p>She was the original Maiden in the Lancre Coven, which consisted of herself, Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg. She is often described as "a wet hen", generally by Granny Weatherwax. Magrat believes in crystals, folk wisdom, and cycles of nature, and is overall a gentle parody of New Age pagans. Magrat's gentle personality allows her to mediate between the oft-clashing Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg, though she does occasionally displays a strong temper herself. Initially she doesn't appear to have much skill at witching magic, despite her large collection of magical jewellery, charms and such ordered from Ankh-Morpork.</p>
<p>Magrat is a doer of good deeds and a worrier, a believer in the goodness of Nature and the psychic benefits of aromas and colours. Magrat believes in occult jewellery, magic knives, songs and folk wisdom. She is very much like a Roundworld New Age pagan, Pratchett poking fun of the whole concept. In fact she is the epitome of that wooly philosophy, nursing fallen baby birds until they die and never giving up hope until her husband and her country are attacked, at which point she channels Warrior-Queen Ynci and goes out in vintage armour like a Lancre Boadecia to save them.

<h4>Queen Magrat</h4>
<p>Magrat meets her future husband, Verence, when he is the court jester or fool for the Duke of Lancre, Felmet (Verence is unaware of his heritage at that time.) They gradually and with great difficulty fall in love - neither very practiced or practical in the art of wooing. After a long engagement, Magrat marries King Verence II and becomes Queen of Lancre. Their engagement is not without strife as Magrat becomes completely fed up with Granny Weatherwax ordering her around and interfering in her life, especially when Granny convinces Verence to plan her entire wedding behind Magrat's back and without her consent. As a consequence of becoming queen, Magrat gives up on witching, abandoning all of her various magical trinkets by throwing them in the River Lancre. She helps repel the elves' invasion of Lancre by using old iron equipment and the non existent Warrior-Queen Ynci as inspiration.</p>
<p>As queen, Magrat tries to support Verence's ambition to modernise and democratise Lancre although she knows that the citizens have little appetite for change and less for democracy; she is a buffer between the eager king and his lackadaisical country.</p>
