    <h2>Rincewind Saga</h2>
    <p>One of the funniest sagas of Mundodisco. The story begins with Rincewind, a sorcerer with no capacity for magic, whose only interest is to live a boring life without surprises, but causality leads his life to unfold at the opposite pole of his ambitions. His adventures, usually on the run, allow the reader to learn much about the geography of Discworld and its underlying workings.</p>

    <p class="justify-text">In a flat world supported by four impassive elephants (who rest on the back of a giant tortoise) inhabit the bizarre characters of this novel: a greedy and clumsy sorcerer, a naive tourist whose fierce luggage follows him everywhere supported by hundreds of paws, dragons that only exist if you believe in them, guilds of thieves and assassins, magic swords, Death and, of course, an extensive catalog of wizards and demons...</p> <br>

    <p class="justify-text">A new day, serene and peaceful, begins on the Discworld. As usual, the great turtle sails through the ether given over to inscrutable reflections, holding in its shell the four elephants on which the world rests. However, an inexorable collision with a malevolent red star is looming, and only one person can remedy the impending disaster: Rincewind, the inept and cowardly wizard. Unfortunately, Rincewind was last seen falling off the edge of the world...</p>

    <p class="justify-text">Eric is the Discworld's would-be demonologist. Too bad he's not very good at it. All he asks is that he be granted... All he asks is that three wishes be granted: dominion over all the kingdoms of the world, the most beautiful woman who ever lived, and to live for eternity. Come on, the usual. He would just have to snap his fingers... If he had summoned the right being.</p>

    <p class="justify-text">The oldest and most inscrutable empire on the Discworld is in a bit of a turmoil. With education, yes. And they are to blame for everything, in this order: a revolutionary pamphlet entitled What I did on my vacation..., the wizard Rincewind and his faithful Luggage..., a horde of barbarians led by an old hero named Genghis Cohen... and a very special butterfly.</p>

    <p class="justify-text">This is not a book about Australia, but about a totally different country that, however, purely by chance, is in some ways a little... Australian. It is a dry and hot territory where everything that is not poisonous is poisonous. But, even so, it is a beautiful place, and it is threatened with death. Will the inept wizard Rincewind manage to save him?</p>

    <p class="justify-text">He is a living legend, the Discworld's greatest hero. He still remembers the adventures in the good old days. He still remembers when heroes didn't have to deal with backaches, pen pushers, or the consequences of "civilization." He still remembers how hard to swing his sword... though some days he can't remember where he left his false teeth.</p>

But beware... They won't be able to resort to magic! Luckily, they have the help of four workers: Trev, a friendly thug who has football in his blood; Juliet, a beautiful girl who is a little lazy but with a good heart, whose debut as a model will revolutionize fashion; Glenda, the essential night cook; and Mr. Nutt, whose origins are a mystery to everyone, including himself.</p>

    <h2>More Wizards Stories</h2>
   <img src="eric-mundodisco.jpg" alt="eric_discworld">
    <p>The wizards of the Unseen University only starred in one novel, apart from the Science of the Discworld trilogy, but they are an important part of several other story lines. In the early books, the Unseen University staff was constantly changing due to the old university tradition whereby a wizard rose through the ranks by assassinating his or her immediate superior. So much so, that murder was considered a cause of natural death among magicians. But this changed drastically with the arrival at the Archchancellery of Mustrum Ridcully, a wizard who (unlike his fellow professors) lived an active and exercised country life (the main hobbies of UU wizards are eating six large meals a day and smoke like chimneys) that has made it almost impossible to remove through traditional University means. Some prominent members of the UU are Ponder Stibbons (a young wizard interested in magical research, whose experiments resemble those of particle physics), the Librarian (a wizard who is transformed into an orangutan by a magical accident and who refuses to be returned to his human form), the Treasurer (a clinically insane wizard, who takes frog extract pills, an anxiolytic equivalent on Discworld) or HEX ("Hex" in some novels, an organic computer used by magicians in their thaumaturgical experiments).</p>
    <p>These are the novels where magicians have an important role</p>

    <p class="justify-text">Death has disappeared. She's supposed to be…um…elsewhere. Which leads to the kind of chaos that always ensues when a utility is pulled. Meanwhile, on a small farm far, far away, a tall, dark stranger is proving to be quite skilled at handling a sickle. There is a harvest to reap...</p>

    <p class="justify-text">The Discworld is a planet like any other, only different. It is flat and is supported by four elephants which in turn are supported by the shell of Great A'Tuin, the largest tortoise you have ever seen. Now the fairies have returned. Granny Weatherwax and her little coven take on real elves. With a complete accompaniment of dwarfs, sorcerers, trolls and an orangutan. And lots of songs and blood everywhere. It is Summer Night. It's not time to dream..</p>

    <p class="justify-text" >There is a Death in the family. Susan has just been reminded, to her dismay. Because precisely now Death has just disappeared and she, his (adoptive) granddaughter, has to take care of the family business. However, despite riding the white horse and wielding the scythe, everyone seems determined to mistake her for a fairy. And on top of that, there is also that Music with Rocks Inside that is taking over the Discworld. It's new. It's catchy. It has rhythm and you can dance. She is alive...</p>

  <p class="justify-text">It's Hogswatch, the winter festival that marks the new year on the Discworld. The children sleep and wait for Papa Hog to come down the chimney and leave them their presents. However, something strange is happening. The visitor is not a potbellied old man with a white beard. It reminds more of a skeleton. Not much is made clearer by the pillow tied around his waist under the red suit. He exclaims "Ho, ho, ho ho!" in a mournful tone and seems more used to using the scythe than to handing out candy inside his socks. But someone has to do the job, because Hogfather is... well, for lack of a better word, dead. And if not enough people believe in him by tomorrow morning, the sun won't peek over the edge of the world.</p>
